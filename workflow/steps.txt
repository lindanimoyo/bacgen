BacGen Pipeline steps   
1.Raw sequence quality control:  
The quality of raw sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC to ensure high-quality data for downstream analyses. Raw reads in FASTQ format were processed, and 
quality reports were generated.  
2.Trimming and filtering:
Reads were trimmed and filtered using Trimmomatic to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences. The trimming process involved removing low-quality bases from 
the ends of reads and discarding reads shorter than 36 bases.  
3.Genome assembly:   
High-quality reads were assembled into contigs using Unicycler. The assembly process produced contigs that were used in subsequent analyses.  
4.AMR gene detection:   
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were identified using Abricate with MEGAres database. Abricate scans genomic assemblies for known resistance genes and generates
a comprehensive report detailing the detected AMR genes.  
5.Plasmid detection:   
Plasmids within the assembled genomes were detected using the PlasmidFinder database in Abricate. This process involved scanning the assembled contigs for plasmid
sequences and reporting the identified plasmid types.  
6.Virulence gene detection:   
Virulence genes were identified using the VFDB database in Abricate. This step involved scanning the genomic assemblies for known virulence factors and generating a
report of the detected virulence genes.  
7.Network analysis and Validation:   
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the pipeline, multiple validation steps were incorporated. The quality of the genome assemblies was assessed using QUAST, 
evaluating N50, L50, total length, and GC content. AMR gene detection was cross-validated with a ResFinder web service,. Similarly, plasmid and virulence gene
detections were cross-validated with other databases or tools, like PlasmidFinder and VFDB web services. Orthologous gene identification was validated by manually
inspecting a subset of gene pairs to confirm accuracy.The accuracy of the network analysis was ensured by comparing the constructed network to known plasmid
interaction networks and validating the community detection results with known plasmid relationships.
